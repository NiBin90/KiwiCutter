## Setup

The setup is pretty simple.

 - Create a virtual environment (see [here](https://github.com/Unbabel/KiwiCutter/blob/master/exercises/exercises.md) for more detailed instructions)

And then simply run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

That's it! You're ready to open the python notebook!

```
